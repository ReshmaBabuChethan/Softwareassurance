### Top-Claim 4: Magento minimizes leakage of sensitive data

For any eCommerce platform, online transactions and personal information are key things to be protected. This yields to crucial issues and reputation damage if not handled properly. Here we are trying to assure how well Magento secures its sensitive data. Magento security and privacy policies meet legal requirements and industry compliance for online merchants. These are mandated by Payment Card Industry (PCI) and law.

#### Evidence E4.1:

- The business that accepts payment by credit card over the internet should follow a set of requirements established by the Payment Card Industry (PCI). As merchants handle customer credit card information they should maintain a secure server environment by adhering to these guidelines. Adhering to PCI guidelines, Magento protects payment data by providing extensive security to payment transactions thereby avoiding easy access to payment details or preventing skimming of payment data. This is evident from [Magento PCI compliance documentation](https://magento.com/pci-compliance?_ga=2.179952685.867899796.1601778413-1356859247.1599591671) which shows the steps Magento implements to be PCI compliant.

#### Evidence E4.2:

- Merchants have to comply with having a strong customer authentication requirement set by the Payment Service Directive (PSD2). To authenticate the payment transactions, Magento facilitates strong customer authentication such as utilizing password/PIN, security token, biometric, etc. Magento uses a secure payment gateway which is complied with PSD2 to ensure payment security. Its online transactions are highly secured as it uses Braintree and Paypal payment modules. Hence Magento is trustworthy as almost all eCommerce websites use these payment modules for online transactions. [Magento payment services documentation](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/stores/compliance-payment-services-directive.html) elaborates on payment module.

#### Evidence E4.3:

- Magento follows California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPA) guidelines to protect sensitive data. Exploiting userâ€™s personal information as in name, phone number, address is against the law. If the software does not handle privacy policies properly then users lose trust in the system. [Magento privacy policy documentation](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/stores/compliance-ccpa.html) talks more regarding CCPA and GDPA compliance.

#### Evidence E4.4:

- Magento avoids unauthorized access and protects its site being error prone. It provides proper security with a strong login mechanism for Admin users to ensure all high level and storefront data are safe, as further explained in [Top-Claim C5](https://github.com/pradeepkoneti/Softwareassurance/issues/52).

Thus, with all the above-mentioned evidences Magento adheres to protect payment and sensitive data.
