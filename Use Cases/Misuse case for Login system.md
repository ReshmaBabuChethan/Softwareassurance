Usecase

       The website client wants to make a purchase on the website. For that the client can create an account or if already had one login to it. The account can store different personal information, such as name, last name, address, phone number, credit card number and others.
       MisUse Case
       A hacker with the intention of stealing the user information, or even use the online shop for them, can use different attacks to achieve its purpose, such as: 
       •	Dictionary attacks: that takes advantage of the fact that people tend to use common words and short passwords;
       •	Brute force attacks: that normally use a program to generate likely passwords or random character sets;
       •	Keylogging: that records the keys struck on a keyboard;
       Security Requirement
       Since dictionary attacks and brute force attacks are similar, these attacks can be prevented with similar actions that includes that the user is required to use strong passwords (at least 8 characters, mixture of both uppercase and lowercase letters, a mixture of letters and numbers, inclusion of at least one special character), the website to limit the max number of logging attempts, use of captcha and enable the use of two steps verifications.
       For the keylogging, the system can enable the use of two steps verifications and prompt the software owner to update the software regularly.
